# 1_Makefile_basic

There are the countless source files in a project, which are placed in serveral pathes by type, function and module. The makefile defines a series of rules to specify which files shall be built at first, which files shall be build later and which files shall be rebuilt.  The makefile likes a shell supporting complex functions.
